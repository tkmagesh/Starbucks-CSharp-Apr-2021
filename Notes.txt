C#
    Java like
        Object Oriented
        Garbage Collector
        Pointer free

    Functional Language
        Functions are first class citizens
            Functions can be treated like objects
                Can be assigned to variables
                Higher Order Functions
                    Functions as arguments
                    Can be returned as returned values
